# Wrapper script to build the required PSyAD targets.
# The PSyAD kernels are built using three stages.
# 1) Pre-patch: copies (and patches) tangent linear kernels from their base dir to PSYAD_WDIR.
# 2) PSyAD: generates adjoint kernel and adjoint test algorithm from the pre-patch stage tangent linear kernels.
# 3) Post-patch: copies (and patches) adjoint kernels and adjoint test algorithms from PSYAD_WDIR to WORKING_DIR.

# List of targets needed by this script.
